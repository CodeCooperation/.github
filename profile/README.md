## Hi there 👋


### 🙋‍ We are CodeCooperation

🙋‍♀️ **CodeCooperation** designs, builds and manages software from the heart of Berlin and Tunis.
We are not an average outsource software agency that builds software products and throws the code at the client. 

We think long term because we love and believe in the products we build.

### 🌈 We do
Ideation. Validation. Design. Development. Software Architecture. CTO. Building Dev Teams. Scaling. Funding. Migrations. Maintenance. Testing.

CodeCooperation is not interested in short term earnings. We are interested in becoming a founding partner of your startup and being paid by equity. 

Our main IDEA is to offer Startups (different stages) a long term and scalable CTO and/or Development support. This can range from building a complete application to separate modules, components and/or features. For this work we charge only our low self costs.

### 📈 We would love to become your Co-Founder if you are a
